# hello-world

Hello! I'm Troy. I joined SoloLearn in October 2017. In the beginning, I started out slow. However, I began having so much fun that I spent more time coding. Now I'm able to create a simple webpage using HTML and CSS. I'm happy with my progress and look forward to becoming a Full Stack developer.
